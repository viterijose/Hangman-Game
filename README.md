# Hangman-Game

Simple hangman game applying logic via Javascript, styling using CSS as well as Bootstrap 3.2 , and various HTML elements for interaction with the user.

## How to play

- To begin the game press the green Start button on the right hand side of the screen, this will randomly select a word from an array of words I've setup in the script.

- Press any letter you wish to guess, if the guess is correct the letter will be displayed by switching the underscore character with the letter you've guessed. If the guess is incorrect you will loose a try and a Hangman body part will be displayed in the canvas element to the right.

- Continue guessing until you've guessed the correct letter or have lost the game!

- If you loose the game you can always rerun the logic by pressing the Restart button.
